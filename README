1. Basic info
This is a remake of the classic Minesweeper game using the ncurses library. It
is very basic and is in no way intended to be a fully-featured remake. At the
moment it features a single difficulty level with a 20x20 minefield.

2. Controls
Movement uses vim-style bindings:
h - move left
j - move down
k - move up
l - move right
f - flag cell
space - activate cell
q - end game/quit

3. Rules
The goal is to activate all the cells that do not contain mines. You can flag
cells that you believe to contain mines in order to avoid accidental activation
thereof. The game is lost when a cell containing a mine is activated.

A number in an activated cell shows how many mines are contained in its
immediate neighbours, e.g. consider the following:
+   1 - this cell has one mine neighbouring it
+ 2 + - the cell marked with 2 has 2 mines neighbouring it
+ + +
The mines (X) may be located as follows:
+   1
+ 2 X
X + +

4. Representation
+ - unchecked cell
  - checked empty cell (may contain a number instead, see section 3)
? - flagged cell
X - activated mine
